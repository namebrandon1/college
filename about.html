		<h2>Problem with traditional canteen system  is  wastage  of  time  for  with  customer  and  staff.
				The Project College Canteen System enables the end users to register online, read and select the food from e-menu card and order food  online by just selecting the food that the user want to have. The results after selecting the food from the E-menu card will directly appear on the screen near the Chef who is going to cook the food for you. By using this application the work of the waiter is reduced and we can also say that the work is nullified. The user will have a username and a password, by using which they can login into the system. This implies that the customer is the regular user of the Canteen. Including a framework showing how to apply Internet technology progressively as skills and confidence grow, the project demonstrates the route from adapting materials to developing an online environment. Nowadays people donâ€™t have much time to spend in canteen by just there and wait for their order. Many customers visit the canteen in their lunch break and recess so they have limited time to eat and return to their respective office and colleges. So this software helps them to save time and order food whenever they want without calling the waiter again and again.</h2>
